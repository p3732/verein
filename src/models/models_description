To keep the DB concept clean, all schemes reside in seperate folders, grouped by category.
Each schemes should, apart from the defined attributes, also list all attributes that are required.

The syntax for these attributes is:

<-  outgoing association
<-> mapping (bidirectional association)
()  the association is created from the other side

1   there is only one object refered to/from
n   refers to/from multiple objects
